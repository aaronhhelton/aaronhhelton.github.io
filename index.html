        <p>Abiogenisis is the moment life on earth began, when non-living matter miraculously, or chemically, turned into living bacteria; the connection between chemistry and biology.</p> 
        <p class ="bold">How did some random falling space rock covered with water, dirt, and moltan lava give birth to the organisms we evolved from? When was that spark of life charged or that seed of humanity laid? Was it the hand of God? Was it lightning striking some obscure soup of atoms? We don't know, but scientists have some pretty cool theories. None more pioneering than Stanley Miller and Harold Urey. </p>
        <p>In their famous "Miller and Urey Experiment", these scientists showed how earth's climate billions of years ago could create the building blocks of life. The experiment was simple, consisting of boiling water whose vapors would pass through electrically charged gasses. The vapor would then get cooled, collected, and flowed back into the same resevior to be boiled again, repeating the same process over and over. This inevitably lead to the creation of 20 different amino acids- the fundamental compounds that make up protein!</p>
        
<h2 id="P&A" class="topic">Plato & Aristotle</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 3/15/20</h6>
        
        <p>Are you a modern day Liberal who thinks conservatives are rigid traditionalists stuck in the past, unable to improve society or shake their abstract social constructs? Maybe you're a Conservative who thinks progressives see the world the way they wish it was at the cost of seeing it for what it actually is, trading a decent grasp of empirical, objective reality for a more aesthetically pleasing idealogy. Left. Right. Blue. Red. Donkey. Elephant. Hippie. Yuppie. Plato. Aristotle.</p>
<p class="bold">Centuries before talk radio and televised news, these debates were being waged in academic institutions and governmental halls of power by the Ancient Greeks, namely Plato and Aristotle. </p>
<p>Plato was the idealist. Aristotle, the realist. Plato thought the only thing real or in existance itself were ideas. Aristotle thought the only thing that was real was reality itself, the material world, what we can actually observe. Plato wanted to abolish the family unit, private property, gender roles, and other social constructs for the most structural, or "Guardian" classes, of the population in order to form a perfect, unified state. He saw selfishness as a root cause to most of society's ills whereas Aristotle saw selfishness as society's greatest driver of true progress so long as it was utalized properly.</p> 
<p>Aristotle claimed that human selfishness was the one and only true motivator for survival and prosperity, not just within one's true nature but within the nature of society and its governing state. He countered Plato by asserting that repressing or attempting to bypass human selfhishness is futile and counterproductive whereas harnessing it with a healthy balance of laws and various social constructs would truly empower both human and the state that governs them.
